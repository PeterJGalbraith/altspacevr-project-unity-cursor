# Peter Galbraiths's Submission for the AltspaceVR Programming Project - Unity Cursor

## Deliverables

In this repo, there are 2 new builds. They reside under "/Builds/PeterJGalbraith's Builds". The one titled "Part 1 - Complete.exe" only includes Part 1 of the project for simple testing of basic criteria. The other includes Part 1 and 2 and contain the enhancements as well as the code from Part 1.

Part 1 creates the cursor movement as desired and implements the custom shader so that it appears always on top

The primary enhancements made to Part 2 are some small scene manipulations, including the addition and fixing of some colliders on furniture, as well as the ability to hold down the right mouse button to look around (emulating Unity's editor look around). Also, included in Part 2 is the ability to apply a force to an interactable object using the mouse's scrollwheel. Force is applied in the direction of the ray from screen to the cursor, at the point where that ray hits the object. I included some a Jenga-like tower of blocks in the scene you may use to test this feature or you may simply move the other objects around the scene using the scrollwheel to "redecorate".
